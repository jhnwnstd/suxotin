# Suxotin's Algorithm Implementation

## Overview
This repository hosts two implementations of Suxotin's algorithm, designed to distinguish vowels from consonants by analyzing their formal properties in texts. It is intended for use by both linguistics researchers and decipherment hobbyists. The algorithm utilizes statistical properties of letter combinations to classify characters based on their typical alternation patterns in various languages.

The exact reasons for the algorithm's effectiveness are not detailed in existing literature, underscoring the importance of further study.

Currently, both implementations effectively identify consonants, but they may mistakenly classify 'n' and 't' as vowels on occasion. Enhancements are needed to improve their robustness and to expand their usability with different text corpora.

## Background
Suxotin's algorithm was extensively tested in computer experiments across multiple languages including Russian, English, French, German, and Spanish, demonstrating robustness with minimal errors. Detailed descriptions and theoretical justifications of the algorithm are available in the `vowel-algorithm.sty` file.

## Features
- **Text Preprocessing**: Converts text to lowercase and removes non-alphabetic characters, preparing it for analysis.
- **Frequency Matrix Generation**: Creates a matrix to count transitions between each pair of characters within words.
- **Vowel and Consonant Separation**: Uses the generated matrix to determine the most likely vowels and consonants based on the frequency of their transitions.

## Repository Contents
- `suxotin.py`: Main Python script implementing Suxotin's algorithm using `numpy` for optimized matrix operations.
- `suxotin2.py`: Alternative implementation of Suxotin's algorithm using Pythonâ€™s standard libraries, specifically `collections.defaultdict` and `Counter`.
- `sherlock_holmes.txt`: Sample text file for testing the algorithm.
- `vowel-algorithm.sty`: Contains two prose descriptions of Suxotin's algorithm.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and usage instructions.

## Usage
The scripts can handle text input directly from files within the working directory. Here are the steps to run the scripts:
1. Ensure that Python is installed on your system.
2. To execute a script with a specified text source:
   - For `suxotin.py` (which requires numpy): `python suxotin.py sherlock_holmes.txt`
   - For `suxotin2.py`: `python suxotin2.py sherlock_holmes.txt`

## Installation
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the necessary Python packages:
   ```
   pip install numpy
   ```
   Note: `numpy` is required for `suxotin.py`.
